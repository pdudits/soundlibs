README for tritonus/test

Most programs in this directory have been developed for special purposes
during the implementation of Tritonus. They are not intended as general tests.
Some are outdated and won't compile.

As reference programs for testing Tritonus installations, use programs from
the Java Sound Examples:
http://www.jsresources.org/exampes/
Especially recommanded are AudioPlayer and MidiPlayer.

The directory suite contains a test suite for Tritonus. It is based on junit.
Parts of the test suite are of general nature, so that other Java Sound
implementations can be tested with it.
