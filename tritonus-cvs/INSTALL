Installing instructions for Tritonus, version 0.3.1

First: do you really need to build Tritonus yourself?
For several common cases, this is not necessary. These cases are:
- you want to do mp3 decoding (all platforms)
- you want to do mp3 encoding (Linux i386, Windows)
- you want to do GSM 06.10 decoding or encoding (all platforms)
- you want to do ogg/vorbis decoding (all platforms)
- you want to do CD digital audio extraction (Linux i386)
For these cases, precompiled components are available. Go to:
http://www.tritonus.org/plugins.html
If you want to have kaffe with Java Sound, use the cvs of kaffe
(Tritonus has been integrated there). Go to:
http://www.kaffe.org/


Which components do i need?
[TODO: Which coponents to compile/install]



What you need
=============

- jdk 1.5.x. Testing was done with the
Sun jdk 1.5.0-b64. Other versions may work.
If you want to compile Linux specific components, it is recommended to do
it on a Linux system, so you need a j2sdk for Linux. Cross-compiling has not
been tested.
If you only want to build pure-java (not Linux specific) components, you
can use a j2sdk on any platform.
Tritonus does not work with jdk1.1.X.
There are no experiences with gcj. Reports are welcome.

- Optional: jikes (recommended, testing was done with version 1.16)

- Either: the Enlightened Sound Daemon (esd or EsounD). On Debian
systems, install the packages esound-common, esound, libesd0 and
libesd0-dev. On Suse systems, install the package esound. If esd is
not part of your Linux distribution, look at www.gnome.org. Make sure
you have not only the daemon and the shared library, but also the header
files for libesd.

  NOTE: this is kept more or less as a compatibility option. Esd is
  considered a badly designed program. Using ALSA is highly
  recommended.

- Or: ALSA 0.9.0rc2 or later or the corresponding cvs state. Get it
from http://www.alsa-project.org/. It is recommended to use ALSA if
you want to get high-performance, low-latency operation, or reliable
full-duplex. It is a necessity if you want professional-grade MIDI support.
Testing was done with ALSA 0.9.0rc2. 0.9.0rc3 has been reported to work.

  STILL ANOTHER NOTE: currently, Tritonus' ALSA handling does not do
  software mixing. This means that for normal JS operation (multiple
  SourceDataLines/Clips) your soundcard has to support hardware
  mixing. Common chipsets that do this are emu10k1 (SB Life!) and
  Trident NX (e.g. Hoontech 4DWaveNX). Otherwise, you will get only
  one line at a time. In other words: if your soundcard does not do hw
  mixing, you need to choose the esd options to have multiple lines.


For MIDI:
- Either: ALSA (see above)

- Or: MidiShare. Get it from http://www.grame.fr/MidiShare/.

For cdda:
- cdparanoia III version 9.8. Version 9.7 is not sufficient.

For the build process:
- make (Testing done with GNU make 3.79)
- ant (Testing done with Apache Ant 1.6; 1.5 should work, too. 
  Get it from http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/ if not present in your distribution)
- gcc
- libtool (currently not needed)
- m4
- cpp
- javah (for building the native libraries)


Building mp3 related components
-------------------------------

The ant based build requires that javalayer.jar is already compiled
and that it is available in the classpath during the build. Only then
the mp3 SPI plug-in gets compiled and packaged.


Installing steps
================

---------------------
Currently, the build process is a mess.
I'm currently building with these commands:

../tritonus> autoconf
../tritonus> ./configure
../tritonus> ant -f build-dtd.xml
../tritonus> ant
../tritonus> make -C src/lib/alsa
../tritonus> make -C src/lib/vorbis
../tritonus> make -C src/lib/...

If you want ant to use jikes, issue:

../tritonus> ant -Dbuild.compiler=jikes

[IDEA: options to configure: build-prefix, install-prefix]

Installation never worked really well. I did (by hand):
> cd /usr/local/java/j2sdk1.4.0/jre/lib/ext
> ln -s /home/matthias/java/tritonus/dist/tritonus_xxx.jar
...
> cd i386
> ln -s /home/matthias/java/tritonus/src/lib/alsa/libtritonusalsa.so
...
(Of course adapt the paths to your system.)

---------------------
OLD

1. Unpack the distribution. It should unpack into a directory
tritonus-<version>. cd into the top-level directory.

2. Issue 'configure' ('./configure' if you build as root) in the
top-level directory. If you are building from the cvs, you have to
create configure from configure.in by calling 'autoconf'. Note that
autoconf 2.52 hat a bug that prevents Tritonus' configure from working
correctely. Tested (and working) versions are 2.53 and 2.13.

THE OLD WAY

3. Issue 'make' or 'make compileinitial' (the second one is
faster). There are spurious compilation errors with some jdk1.1
versions. Just restart with 'make' (even if you originally said 'make
compileinitial') and they will go away. This may be necessary several
times.


THE NEW WAY

3. Issue 'ant'.

-- following needs to be updated --

4. Issue 'make install'. This will copy the files tritonus.jar,
javalayer.jar, libesdtritonus.so.1.0 and libtritonusalsa.so.1.0 into
the directory tree of the jdk, thereby installing it as an
extension. Note that this works only if you have a jdk/jre1.2 or
higher and java is accessible in the path. If you have jdk/jre1.1.x,
you have to set the CLASSPATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include the above
files. The important files are:

- tritonus-x.y.z/tritonus.jar - this contains the java classes and
should be in your CLASSPATH

- tritonus-x.y.z/javalayer.jar - this contains the java classes for
the mp3 decoder (seperated because of legal reasons). They should be
in your CLASSPATH, too.

- tritonus-x.y.z/src/lib/alsa/libtritonusalsa.so.1.0 (if you use the
MIDI stuff)

- tritonus-x.y.z/src/lib/esd/libtritonusesd.so.1.0

this contains the native 
code and should be in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH


USING TRITONUS WITH SUN/IBM/BLACKDOWN JDK 1.3/1.4

If you are using Tritonus with a jdk/jre that already has an
implementation of the Java Sound API (this is true for 1.3/1.4), you
have two choices:

1. Use only the components of Tritonus that are not available/not
working correctely in the native Java Sound implementation.

2. Completely replace the Java Sound implementation by Tritonus.

Since 1.3 and 1.4 behave sligtly different with respect to this issue,
there are even more pitfalls.

If you just want to use one of Tritonus' FormatconversionProviders,
MixerProviders or MidiDeviceProviders (these are the most common
cases), put the respective tritonus_xxx.jar into either the user class
path or the extension class path. Using the user class path can be
convenient for quick tests. However, for permanent installation it is
not recommanded. The reason is that executing a VM with 'java -jar
...' overrides the user class path with the location of the .jar given
on the command line. So Tritonus .jars put into the user class path
become unavailable. Manipulating the boot class path is generally
highly discouraged (see below for a useful, but still critical use of
the boot class path). The remaining (and recommanded) way is to use
the extension class path.

Additionally, put native libs of .jar that need one into a generally
system-accessible location (for instance /usr/lib/, /usr/local/lib,
...). To install native libs in a custom location, you typically need
to change the value of the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

This done, the components should be available to Java
Sound. MixerProviders contribute to the list of Mixers
(AudioSystem.getMixerInfo()). MidiDeviceProviders contribute to the
list of MidiDevices
(MidiSystem.getMidiDeviceInfo()). FormatConversionProviders are
considered implicitely (by AudioSystem.getTargetEncodings(),
AudioSystem.getTargetFormats(), AudioSystem.isConversionSupported(),
AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream()).

With jdk 1.3.X, the pitfall is that making the providers available does
NOT automatically change the default devices (as returned/used by
AudioSystem.getLine(), MidiSystem.getSynthesizer(),
MidiSystem.getReceiver(), MidiSystem.getTransmitter(),
MidiSystem.getSequencer(), MidiSystem.getSynthesizer()). The jdk
searches the class paths for available providers in this order: boot
class path, extension class path, user class path. Since the
'built-in' providers appear in rt.jar, which appears in the boot class
path, its devices act as defaults. Devices provided by
additionally installed providers are available on explicit request
(AudioSystem.getMixer(), MidiSystem.getMidiDevice()).

With jdk 1.4, the defaults change without asking you, and exactely
this can be a pitfal, too. This is due to the fact that the the search
order for provider is reversed. Here, it is: user class path,
extension class path, boot class path. So devices provided by
additional providers can act as default devices.

So with jdk1.4, your job is easy, while with jdk1.3 you have to
explicitely name alternative Mixers and MidiDevices. Note that it is
not a good idea to hard-code Tritonus' Mixer or MidiDevice names. The
recommanded practice (anyway) is to give the user a list of available
Mixers and MidiDevices and let her/him select an appropriate
one. These choices may be stored as preferences. If the user doesn't
explicitely select devices, default devices should be used (as
provided by the Java Sound implementation, not hard-coded ones).

You may want to opt to completely replace the jdk's Java Sound
implementation by Tritonus. There are not many cases where this does
make sense. It can be necessary to shadow severe bugs, but there are
few of them. For now, it's mainly an option for testing Tritonus. It
is not recommanded for normal users. Here is how it works:

Since the native versions of the javax.sound.* classes are in the boot
class path, it is necessary to alter the boot class path. Start the VM
with the following options:

java -Xbootclasspath/p:/path/to/tritonus_core.jar:/path/to/tritonus_share.jar

This prepends some of the Tritonus .jars to the boot class path,
resulting in Tritonus' versions of javax.sound.* shadowing the native
ones. Note that this still does not remove the native service
providers. To remove them, you have to edit or remove configuration
files packaged in rt.jar. The easiest way is to just remove them. So,
remove the following files from rt.jar:

META-INF/services/javax.sound.midi.spi.MidiDeviceProvider
META-INF/services/javax.sound.midi.spi.MidiFileReader
META-INF/services/javax.sound.midi.spi.MidiFileWriter
META-INF/services/javax.sound.midi.spi.SoundbankReader
META-INF/services/javax.sound.sampled.spi.AudioFileReader
META-INF/services/javax.sound.sampled.spi.AudioFileWriter
META-INF/services/javax.sound.sampled.spi.FormatConversionProvider
META-INF/services/javax.sound.sampled.spi.MixerProvider

Be sure to keep a copy of the original rt.jar, so that you can easily
restore the original state.

And again: Be warned that this is a guru-level option. Don't dare to
ask for help on a mailing list if something fails. You have to know
what you are doing.

ALSA
----

The MIDI stuff of tritonus makes heavy use of the ALSA sequencer.
ALSA is the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture
(http://www.alsa-project.org), a new soundcard driver system intended
to replace the OSS/Free driver in future kernels.


HOW TO MAKE IT WORK
-------------------

Use a recent 2.2 kernel. The developer of this stuff uses 2.2.10 and
2.2.14 kernels; every kernel newer than 2.2.3 should work. In the
kernel configuration, enable sound support, but do not include any
concrete driver.  Enabling kernel symbol versioning helps if you
recompile kernels frequently.

Download and install the ALSA drivers/lib/utils version 0.5.x.
You cannot use earlier versions of ALSA due to incompatible
changes.  Be sure to configure '--with-sequencer=yes' in the driver
part.  Install the modules and load the new versions.  Load the
sequencer modules. For help on installing ALSA, see the alsa-user
mailing list (visit the ALSA web site).


Installation check
------------------

> cat /proc/asound/seq/clients
The result should be similar to this:
Client info
  cur  clients : 2
  peak clients : 2
  max  clients : 192

Client   0 : "System" [Kernel]
  Port   0 : "Timer" (system:Rwe:Rwe)
  Port   1 : "Announce" (system:R-e:R-e)
Client  64 : "0: MIDI Synth" [Kernel]
  Port   0 : "MIDI 0-0" (device:RWe:RWe)

If the file doesn't exist at all, load the sequencer module:

	modprobe snd-seq

If the file exists, but the "MIDI Synth" doesn't show up, load the
MIDI client module:

	modprobe snd-seq-midi

If the internal synthesizer of your card is supported (not all
cards), you can load the synth support, too:

	modprobe snd-seq-synth

There may be additional lines if you have more than one soundcard,
your soundcard has more than one MIDI port or the internal synth of
the soundcard is supported.

Second install check
--------------------

Install pmidi (http://www.parabola.demon.co.uk/alsa/pmidi.html).
You need version 1.4.0 or later.
Call 'pmidi -l'. The output should be similar to this:
 Port     Client name                       Port name
 64:0     0: MIDI Synth                     MIDI 0-0

Connect a synthesizer to the MIDI out of your computer.  Call 'pmidi
-p 64:0 <midifile>'.  '64:0' should be the number shown in the first
column of the output from 'pmidi -l'. The MIDI file should be played
on your synth.

(Hopefully) finished!
---------------------

Now you should be able to use Tritonus with the ALSA sequencer.
