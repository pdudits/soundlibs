Usage
=====

For reading CDs digitally, a special URLHandler is used to provide a
high-level interface.

For programs to work seamlessly, you have to execute the following
statement once:

	[import	org.tritonus.sampled.cdda.CddaURLStreamHandlerFactory;]

	URL.setURLStreamHandlerFactory(new CddaURLStreamHandlerFactory());

(It doesn't harm if it's executed more than once. However, the
recommended method is to do this in a static initializer.)


The URL forms
=============

cdda:
cdda://

returns a list of CDROM drives. For now, a simple list with one line
per drive is provided. The names returned should all start with '/'
(It's not yet clear if it is possible to drop this requirement).  Idea
for the future: return a chunk of XML data that also contain status
information for the drives.

cdda:[drive]

returns the table of content of the drive that is given as a name. The
has to be one of the lines returned by 'cdda:'.  The information is
returned as a chunk of XML data. It contains length, start sector and
other data specific to the tracks.

examples:
cdda:/dev/hdc
cdda:///dev/hdc
returns the table of content for the drive  /dev/hdc


cdda:[drive]#[track]

Returns the digital data of the given track on the given drive.  The
data is in 16 bit linear PCM, stereo.

examples:
cdda:/dev/hdc#4
cdda:///dev/cdrom#4
reads track 4 of the drive /dev/hdc

cdda:#4
cdda://#4
reads track 4 of the default drive


Examples
========

There are two examples in the Java Sound Examples' cvs: CddaPlayer and CddaRipper.


Internal architecture
=====================

The implementation is divided into low-level, mid-level and high-level
parts.

The low-level part is intended to handle native calls to access
operating system specific APIs. The interface can be chosen freely by
the implementor. It typically closely resemble the structure of the
underlying API.  Currently, there are two implementations: One based
on cdparanoia (http://www.xiph.org/paranoia/). The other is based on
Linux' "cooked ioctl" interface. Code is under
src/org/tritonus/lowlevel/cdda/[cdparanoia,cooked_ioctl]/ and
src/lib/[cdparanoia/cooked_ioctl]/.

The mid-level part brings together the different operating-specific
interfaces to a common interface. The common interface is
org.tritonus.lowlevel.cdda.CddaMidLevel. For each low-level part there
should be a corresponding wrapper implementing the mid-level
interface. The implementations are typically in
src/org/tritonus/lowlevel/cdda/*/*MidLevel.java.

The high-level part provides the facilities of the low- and mid-level
parts as an URL. Te form of the URLs is described above. The
implementation is in src/org/tritonus/sampled/cdda/.

open questions:
- url to read the TOC of the default drive?
Reset of AudioInputStream possible?
Restrictions on simultaneous reading of multiple tracks?
Byte order? -- set format of returned ais after endianess that the drive reports?
