    <sect2><title>I am new to Java Sound and want to program a
    telephony application. Is this possible, and if yes, how do I do
    that?</title>

      <para>It is possible. We cannot provide all concepts of digital
      audio in this FAQ. There are many good books on this subject. I
      recommend &quot;the computer music tutorial&quot; from Curtis
      Roads, from MIT press. For simple examples how to do streaming
      audio with Java Sound, see Matthias' Java Sound
      Examples. (Florian)</para>


    <sect2><title>How is the JMF related to Java Sound?</title>

      <para>JMF is a high-level API, designed mainly for easy playback
      of multimedia files, video as well as audio. Java Sound, on the
      other hand, is a rather low-level API, designed for detailed
      control of the audio hardware. (Matthias)</para>



    <!--h3>
      I want sun to change or add to the JS API. What can I do?
      [use javasound-comments, but cc: to javasound-interestcd]
    </h3-->

    <sect2><title>I want a specific feature in future versions of the
    Java Sound API</title>

      <para>You can make specification requests to Sun. To read how to
      do that, go to <ulink
      url="http://java.sun.com/aboutJava/communityprocess/submit.html">http://java.sun.com/aboutJava/communityprocess/submit.html</ulink>.
      You may want to discuss the feature before hand on the mailing
      list. (Florian)</para>

    <sect2><title>The Java Sound API seems fine to me, but many things
    do not seem to be implemented.</title>

      <para>This is a matter of time. Sun will improve the Java Sound
      implementation (and also the API). Other people will provide
      service providers to extend Java Sound. The Tritonus team will
      release parts of Tritonus as service providers so that everybody
      can take advantage of Tritonus' achievements. A native port of
      Tritonus to Windows is planned, too. (Florian)</para>


    <sect2><title>I discovered a bug in a Java Sound implementation</title>

      <para>For the Sun implementation, you can submit it as a bug on
      <ulink
      url="http://java.sun.com/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi">http://java.sun.com/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi</ulink>
      (needs a registration to the developer connection).  For
      Tritonus, use their bug reporting system on <ulink
      url="http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=1390">http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=1390</ulink>.

  <sect1><title>Audio Programming </title>


    <sect2><title>I want to convert a byte[] array to short samples or
    vice versa.</title>

      <para>Look at the Tritonus source code, class
      org.tritonus.sampled.TConversionTool.  You have to look it up in
      the cvs repository in the subdirectory
      src/org/tritonus/sampled. For that, go to <ulink
      url="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/tritonus/src/org/tritonus/sampled/?cvsroot=tritonus">http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/tritonus/src/org/tritonus/sampled/?cvsroot=tritonus</ulink>
      and click on the version number of
      &quot;TConversionTool.java&quot;.  It contains many methods for
      converting byte arrays. (Florian)</para>


    <sect2><title>Playback of audio data with Java Sound is
    significantly quieter than with a compared player on the native
    OS.</title>

      <para>There was the issue that Sun's implementation of Java
      Sound (at least up to version 0.99) lowers the level of output
      in order to avoid clippings when several lines are
      mixed. Probably this &quot;feature&quot; is the problem. </para>

      <para>I find this &quot;feature&quot; quite doubtful. A Java
      Sound programmer should use GainControls attached to single
      lines to lower the volume, if wanted. Many applications won't
      profit of this &quot;feature&quot;: e.g. they only play one line
      at a time.  Or the mixed sounds don't create clippings. This is
      not unusual, as even &quot;normalized&quot; sounds leave most of
      the time enough room - there must coincide peaks to create a
      clipping. The case that the soft synth AND audio are playing
      simultaneously can be expected in &quot;quality&quot; programs
      which provide a way to lower the gain of the lines - or do the
      gain decrease automatically. </para>

      <para>As Java Sound is supposed to be a low-level engine, such
      an approach would not be suitable. The problem of the feature is
      a general decrease of signal-to-noise ratio of all Java Sound
      programs. Automatic lowering of volume prevents the use in
      &quot;serious&quot; or professional
      environments... (Florian)</para>


    <sect2><title>I cannot retrieve any Port instances</title>

      <para>It seems that no implementation of Java Sound provides
      Port instances, yet. (Florian)</para>


    <sect2><title>I want to save audio data to a file, like wav or
    aiff</title>

      <para>Have look at Matthias' Java Sound Examples. (todo: link -
      maybe put them, too, on tritonus.org)</para>


    <sect2><title>I want to be notified when data is available for
    write/read in a SourceDataLine/TargetDataLine</title>

      <para>You have to use
      SourceDataLine/TargetDataLine.available(). The usual
      implementation for streaming audio (in Java Sound) is a
      dedicated thread for that - look at the Java Sound demo which
      you can download from sun or at Matthias' JS
      examples. (Florian)</para>


    <sect2><title>I want to do some processing on an alaw stream (like
    amplifing it)</title>

      <para>It is much easier to change gain with linear encoding
      (PCM). I would strongly suggest that - especially when you have
      the data in linear format at first. You'd have to convert it
      back to alaw after processing. (Florian)</para>


    <sect2><title>I want to implement a real-time AudioInputStream,
    but cannot give a length for it, as it is not known in
    advance</title>

      <para>You should use &quot;AudioSystem.NOT_SPECIFIED&quot; as
      length.  This approach seems logical to me and it works fine in
      my program.  (Florian)</para>


    <sect2><title>I want to add special chunks to wave or aiff files
    (like for a descriptive text or copyright)</title>

      <para>The Java Sound API does not support this currently. Future
      versions are likely to, because this is indeed quite important.
      For the moment, you will need to implement your own class for
      writing wave or aiff files. Or make meaningful
      filenames... (Florian)</para>


    <sect2><title>It fails to open any line with 16KHz sample
    rate</title>

      <para>Apparently, most Java Sound implementations do not provide
      that, even if the sound card supports it. Future implementations
      will support that. (Florian)</para>


    <sect2><title>I have a byte array and want to write these data to
    an audio file.</title>

      <para>Create a ByteArrayInputStream object from the byte array,
      create an AudioInputStream from it, then call
      AudioSystem.write(...).  [TODO: code example, alternative
      approach via AudioOutputStream] (Matthias)</para>


    <sect2><title>I want to get a SourceDataLine or TargetDataLine in
    µ-law format</title>

      <para>TargetDataLines are supposed to act as a
      &quot;direct&quot; way to communicate with the audio hardware
      device, i.e. your soundcard. When your soundcard does not
      support ulaw directly, the TargetDataLine won't either.</para>

      <para>The way to go is to open a TargetDataLine in pcm format
      and route it through a format converter. See doc of AudioSystem
      to get converted Streams. The converted stream you get provides
      ulaw samples then. </para>

      <para>There is no drawback in this approach: all PC soundcards
      that I know of deliver only PCM, so it has to be rendered to
      ulaw anyway in software. Whether in the soundcard's driver, the
      operating system layer or in the application (your java program)
      doesn't matter. You get maximum portability when only using pcm
      for TargetDataLines. (Florian)</para>


    <sect2><title>Simultaneous recording and playback only works when
    first opening the playback line (SourceDataLine)</title>

      <para>This depends on the soundcard and its driver to the native
      operating system. E.g. Soundblaster 16 or 64 do not provide real
      full duplex, only a kind of pseudo full duplex. I experienced
      under Windows that you can only use this pseudo full duplex when
      you have a certain order in opening record/playback
      lines. (Florian)</para>


    <sect2><title>I want to detect the level of sound while I am
    recording it</title>

      <para>First of all, you should have the data in PCM format
      (preferable in signed PCM). Then you can look at the samples to
      detect the amplitude (level). Some statistics are suitable, too,
      like taking the average of the absolute values or
      RMS. (Florian)</para>


    <sect2><title>I want to use multi-channel sound.</title>

      <para>This is currently not possible. It will be supported in
      Tritonus in the future. (Matthias)</para>



    <sect2><title>I'm trying to do sample rate conversion with Java
    Sound, but it doesn't work.</title>

      <para>Currently, no Java Sound implementation supports
      this. Tritonus will do so in the near future, and this will be
      made available as a plug-in for other Java Sound
      implementations.  Also, JMF supports sample rate
      conversion. (Matthias)</para>



    <sect2><title>I want to do equalizing/noise reduction/fft/... with
    Java Sound.</title>

      <para>Java Sound is an API concerned with basic sound input and
      output. It does not contain digital signal processing
      algorithms. Nevertheless, you can do this with Java; you just
      have to code it on your own. The book "Digital Audio with Java"
      by Craig Lindley contains some DSP algorithm. Also, it is often
      easy to transform C or C++ code found on the net to Java.</para>

      <para>For code that does fft, have a look at the <ulink
      url="http://www.seas.smu.edu/~cjuliano/peruna.html">Peruna
      Project</ulink>. (Matthias)</para>


    <sect2><title>I do recording with a TargetDataLine and I want a
    volume control for it.</title>

      <para>The obvious solution would be to get a Control object of
      type VOLUME or GAIN for the TargetDataLine and manipulate the
      volume via this object. However, this is not possible, since
      neither the Sun jdk1.3 nor Tritonus implement any controls for
      TargetDataLines.</para>

      <para>What you can do is to use the system mixer to control the recording
      volume---it affects hardware settings in the soundcard. There is an
      API to manipulate the system mixer from java: the mysterious
      Ports. But again, this is not implemented in any known Java Sound
      implementation (it is planned to implement Ports in future versions of
      Tritonus).</para>

      <para>The remaining possibility is to implement a volume control
      digitally: multiplying each single sample of the sound data with
      a certain value that lowers or raises the level
      proportionally. (Matthias)</para>


    <sect2><title>I want to use an audio clip on a 5 MB audio file,
    but I get an out of memory exception.</title>

      <para>For files of this size, you should stream the audio. Like
      that you treat buffers of small size and feed them successively
      into the the audio device. Look at Matthias' Java Sound
      examples, there are some streaming audio players to take as a
      start.  Java Sound Examples: <ulink
      url="http://rupert.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/~pfistere/jsexamples/">http://rupert.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/~pfistere/jsexamples/</ulink>.
      (Florian)</para>


    <sect2><title>I want to calculate the number of bytes to skip from
    the length in seconds.</title>

      <para>Use one of the following formulas: bytes = seconds *
      sample rate * channels * (bits per sample / 8) or bytes =
      seconds * sample rate * frame size. You can get the sample rate,
      number of channels, bits per sample and frame size from an
      AudioFormat object.  (Matthias)</para>




  <sect1><title>Encodings and file types</title>

    <sect2><title>I want to play back mp3 files</title>

      <para>There is a pure Java decoder of the javazoom project.
      Tritonus, the open source implementation of Java Sound
      incorporates it. There is a plug in available which runs under
      any JVM. (Florian)</para>


    <sect2><title>I want to encode mp3 files with my Java
    program</title>

      <para>Java is free, this collides with the (enforced) licences
      for mp3 encoders. I have studied very carefully the mp3
      licencing model and also asked at Fraunhofer (inventors of mp3)
      for additional information: it won't be possible to deliver a
      free mp3 encoder legally. (If anyone knows a &quot;hole&quot;,
      please let me know. (not the available source code - this is not
      appropriate: the encoders available as source code - most of
      them based on the ISO reference implementation - create bad
      quality mp3's and the licence doesn't allow the use of such
      encoders!))</para>

      <para>The Tritonus team is working on an interface to the open
      source encoder <ulink
      url="http://www.sulaco.org/mp3/">LAME</ulink>.  Like that people
      who do not fear licence problems can download LAME as a separate
      package and link it to Java Sound. (Florian)</para>


    <sect2><title>I want to convert a PCM encoded byte[] to a uLaw
    byte[]</title>

      <para>When you are processing streams, read the documentation of
      javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem. There are functions like
      getAudioInputStream(AudioFormat, AudioInputStream) that do the
      conversion for you. </para>

      <para>In case you absolutely want to do the conversion &quot;by
      hand&quot;, look at how Tritonus is doing it: have a look at the
      file <ulink
      url="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/tritonus/src/org/tritonus/sampled/?cvsroot=tritonus">TConversionTool.java</ulink>.

    <sect2><title>Is there support for RealAudio in Java Sound?</title>

      <para>There isn't, and it doesn't look like there will be in the
      near future. RealAudio is a proprietary format; there is no
      specification available to the public. Due to that, it's hard to
      implement support for it. If you want to change this situation,
      bug RealNetworks to publish specs (politely,
      please). (Matthias)</para>


    <sect2><title>Is there support for GSM in Java Sound?</title>

      <para>Yes, you can download a service provider plug-in for GSM
      from <ulink url="http://www.tritonus.org/plugins.html">Java
      Sound Plugins</ulink>. Since this implementation is pure-java,
      it can be used with any Java Sound implementation on any
      platform. For examples of using the GSM plug-in, see the
      section "dealing with encodings" in the Java Sound Examples.
      (Matthias)</para>



    <sect2><title>Java Sound supports a format called RMF. Where can I get
    documentation about this format?</title>

      <para>You can't. RMF (Rich Music Format) is a proprietary format
      designed by beatnik (www.beatnik.com). They don't release any
      specs to the public. By the way, it's not true for all Java
      Sound implementations to support RMF. Tritonus doesn't for the
      above reason. Instead, it will support MPEG-4 Structured
      Audio.</para>



    <sect2><title>I want to read in a vox file and save it as wav
    file</title>

      <para>Probably it's simplest to do all by yourself: use a
      RandomAccessFile or similar to open the vox file, parse the
      headers, etc. You need to know the vox file format, you can find
      many documents specifying it on the Internet. To create a wave
      file from that, create a AudioFileFormat instance with the
      format read from the vox-header and supply an InputStream with
      the audi data of the vox file. You can then use
      AudioSystem.write to write a wav file. (Florian)</para>

      <para>Tritonus has an almost complete MIDI implementation. If
      you are running Linux, just install Tritonus. I you are using
      Windows95/98, there is an experimental add-on to the Sun jdk1.3
      that can be installed with the Sun jdk1.3. <ulink

      it. (Matthias)</para>


    <sect2><title>I have unstable timing when playing back MIDI
    notes</title>

      <para>Java Sounds synthesizer is a virtual synthesizer - it uses
      your soundcard's audio out and creates the sounds in
      software. That is why there is a delay: audio data is quite huge
      compared to midi data (e.g. 5 bytes compared to 88200 bytes for
      one note). Audio data is put in blocks of a number of samples to
      the soundcard.  When the blocks are 23ms long, you have at least
      23 ms delay.  Another source of delay comes from moving these
      data to the soundcard. Better soundcards, and especially PCI
      soundcards can do the memory transfer very fast. There is also
      more software overhead for audio data - obviously it takes more
      time to calculate and treat audio data than MIDI data.</para>

      <para>I cannot give an authoritative answer to the problem, why
      the delay changes. It may be due to a block-wise implementation
      of the internal Java Sound synthesizer: as the audio data is
      always pushed in blocks to the soundcard, it may be that MIDI
      events are always synthesized from the start of a block. (I just
      wrote (for testing purposes) a drum machine that works like
      this). This results in unequal delay. I am not sure about this
      &quot;theory&quot;, as playing a midi file seems to have perfect
      timing (i.e. midi notes may start inside a block). Let's see
      whether the programmers of the synthesizer engine
      respond. (Florian)</para>



    <sect1><title>Java Sound in Applets</title>

    <!--
<sect2><title>
      I want to record sound in an applet. Is this possible?
    </title>
-->


<sect2><title>
      I heared that signing applets is needed to record sound. Is this true?

      Almost true.

  <sect1><title>Performance issues</title>

    <sect2><title>Is it possible to apply an FFT transform in real
    time under Java ?</title>

      <para>At least for JIT compilers, Java is very fast (under
      certain conditions it reaches or tops C++ performance!) - and I
      think even on no-JIT compilers, FFT analysis is no problem in
      real time, of course depending on available processor power and
      resources. (Florian)</para>


    <sect2><title>How do I reduce latency - or- I want to record sound
    and simultaneously play it back without delay</title>

      <para>You'll never be able to completely remove latency. Digital
      audio on computers is processed in &quot;chunks&quot;, i.e. a
      small number of samples. When recording, you have to wait until
      one chunk is filled, then it gets passed to your application. So
      there is a minimum delay of the time of a chunk latency for
      recording. For playback the same &quot;problem&quot;: the
      soundcard gets chunks from the application, so when one chunk is
      passed, the soundcard starts playing with the first sample of
      the chunk and it takes the time of the chunk that the last
      samples has been played. So, for playback you'll get the same
      delay.  Added to that, the software (i.e. the different hardware
      layers copying chunks, etc.) and the hardware (hardware latency)
      add to the total delay.</para>

      <para>There are approaches like DirectSound, ASIO or Alsa that
      all try to minimize the software part's latency and to allow
      very small chunks. When used efficiently on high-quality
      soundcards, an audio loop is possible with a barely noticeable
      delay (e.g. 20ms).</para>

      <para>Java Sound (and therefore also JMF) actually adds one
      layer to the software part, so latency is slightly increased
      compared to native audio applications. You control the chunk
      size with the buffer size argument when constructing a
      SourceDataLine or TargetDataLine in Java Sound. I don't know
      about JMF's concepts. I also experienced some problems with
      Java Sound recording when using small buffers (like 1024 samples
      at 44KHz). (Florian)</para>


    <sect2><title>I want to provide successive multi track recording:
    I record new channels while playing back all previously recorded
    channels.  However, I get synchronization problems, there are
    different delays</title>

      <para>The delay, of when the data arrives regarded to when you
      started recording, should be quite fixed. However, recording and
      playback may have different delays. The delays depend on the
      soundcard, the operating system (including the sound card
      drivers) and the implementation of Java Sound you use (and also
      a bit on what JDK you use).</para>

      <para>Also, the Java Sound API does not provide means for
      querying the device's latency. This would be quite difficult
      anyway for the Java Sound subsystem. However, normal soundcards
      have very little hardware delay (even the cheap ones), so once
      they receive the command to start recording, they really start
      it in a matter of some milliseconds - typically 20-30ms. </para>

      <para>Using the soundcard via Java Sound, there are many layers
      until the data arrives in your program, so some delay is added.
      However, I haven't noticed a relevant delay when recording. I
      haven't tried to do your approach of measuring the delay,
      though.</para>

      <para>So what you should is, is to call the start() method both
      on TargetDataLine and SourceDataLine &quot;at once&quot; with
      the minimum overhead possible. Notice that the buffers of the
      recording line arrive when they have been finished recording
      (i.e.  when the amount of time has been elapsed), while playback
      lines need a buffer prior that they are played. This may not be
      obvious at first. So when you do record and playback at once,
      the first received block from the recording line corresponds in
      time to the first played buffer (which has been submitted right
      with &quot;start&quot;).</para>

      <para>For playback of the 2 files, you should not use 2 playback
      lines, but mix them from your program. Like that, you can at
      least control the exact sample-delay of the 2 playback lines and
      adjust it (probably only possible by ear).</para>

      <para>These are handmade solutions. The &quot;real&quot;
      solution is to make use of Mixer.synchronize. This is the
      proposed solution to your problem from the Java Sound API. Like
      that you can synchronize the recording line and the playback
      line - or the 2 playback lines. However, it seems that it isn't
      implemented in current versions of Java Sound (although I
      haven't tested it). (Florian)</para>

    <sect2><title>What is endianess/big endian/little endian?</title>

      <para>Most common computers have their memory organized in units
      of 8 bits, called a byte. The bytes can be adressed by ordinal
      numbers, starting with zero. (The harware organization of the
      memory is often in rows of 16, 32, 64, 128 or even more
      bits. But the instruction set of the processor still gives you
      the view of the byte-organized memory.)  If you want to store a
      value that needs more than 8 bits, the question arises how the
      bits of the value are divided in bytes and stored in memory. If
      you have have a value with 16 bits, there is not much discussion
      that it has to be divided into two groups: bit 0 to 7 and bits 8
      to 15. But then, the fight starts. Some CPUs store the first
      group (bit 0 to 7) in the byte with the lower address and the
      second group (bits 8 to 15) in the byte with the higher
      address. This schema is called little-endian. As an example, all
      Intel CPUs are little-endian. Other types of CPUs do it the
      other way round, which is called big-endian. Sparc and PowerPC
      (Motorola) CPUs are big-endian.  (Matthias)</para>

      <para>By default, the java virtual machine terminates when all
      threads have terminated and the main function has also been
      exited. It seems that Java Sound's audio subsystem creates
      threads which remain, so you have to call explicitely
      System.exit(int).  (Florian)</para>


    <sect2><title>I installed Tritonus on a Sun jdk1.3.0 and I still
    get the behaviour of Sun's Java Sound implementation.</title>

      <para>Using Tritonus under jdk1.3.0 is a bit tricky. The point
      is that by installing Tritonus you are just adding Tritonus'
      mixers, converters and other service providers to the ones of Sun's
      Java Sound implementation. Especially, Sun's mixing engine is
      still the default mixer. To use Tritonus' mixers, you have to
      select the mixer in your program manually: get the respective
      Mixer object from AudioSystem, and allocate the lines from this
      Mixer object. The same is true for MidiDevices. It's possible
      to use Tritonus' javax.sound.* classes by putting them into the
      boot classpath *before* rt.jar. But this still leaves you with
      Sun's service providers. Getting rid of them required to change
      the service provider configuration files inside rt.jar or other,
      even more fancy measures. The alternative way out of the hell is
      to use a jdk1.2.X, where Tritonus is the only Java Sound
      implementation.  (Matthias)</para>

    <sect2><title>I want to use com.sun.* classes. Is there any

      <para>No, and it is strongly advised to not use them: these are

      JVM's or even in future JVM's from Sun they may not be

    <sect2><title>I want to play a wave file in an JDK1.1.x
    applet</title>

      <para>First of all, JDK1.1 generally only provides µ-law, 8000Hz mono
      playback. It does not provide wave file playback directly. And
      for playback of audio data of the application, there are only
      the &quot;unofficial&quot; sun.audio.* classes. So you'd need to
      write your own classes that read in the wave files, convert the
      sound data to ulaw and then use the sun.audio.* classes to play
      them. For code that parses wav files and does ulaw conversion
      look at tritonus' source code: <ulink
      url="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/tritonus/src/org/tritonus/sampled/file/?cvsroot=tritonus">http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/tritonus/src/org/tritonus/sampled/file/?cvsroot=tritonus</ulink>
      (WaveAudioFileReader.java) and <ulink
      url="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/tritonus/src/org/tritonus/sampled/?cvsroot=tritonus">http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/tritonus/src/org/tritonus/sampled/?cvsroot=tritonus</ulink>
      (TConversionTool.java). Click on the version number to see the
      source code. Tritonus classes are under the LGPL licence.</para>

      <para>Regarding sun.audio.* classes: it is discouraged to use
      them.  I heard that they don't work anymore as expected in
      jdk1.3. My applets using them work well from jdk1.0 to jdk1.1
      and in all browsers that I could put my hand

    <sect2><title>When I call AudioSystem.getAudioFileTypes(), I

      <para>This is a bug in the Sun jdk1.3.0. It always returns an
      empty array if there are no service provider plug-ins. If you
      have service provider plug-ins installed, it returns only the
      types supported by the plugins, not the "built-in" ones. The
      Tritonus implementation of this method works as
      expected. (Matthias)</para>
