    get the behaviour of Sun's Java Sound implementation.</title>

      <para>Using Tritonus under jdk1.3.0 is a bit tricky. The point
      is that installing Tritonus you are just adding Tritonus'
      mixers, converters and other service providers to ones of Sun's
      Java Sound implementation. Especially, Sun's mixing engine is
      still the default mixer. To use Tritonus' mixers, you have to
      select the mixer in your program manually: get the respective
      Mixer object from AudioSystem, and allocate the lines from this
      Mixer object. The same is true for MidiDevices. It's possible
      to use Tritonus' javax.sound.* classes by putting them into the
      boot classpath *before* rt.jar. But this still leaves you with
      Sun's service providers. Getting rid of them required to change
      the service provider configuration files inside rt.jar or other,
      even more fancy measures. The alternative way out of the hell is
      to use a jdk1.2.X, where Tritonus is the only Java Sound
      implementation.  (Matthias)</para>
