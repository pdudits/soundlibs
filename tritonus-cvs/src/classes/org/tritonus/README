core/

Classes that are needed by Tritonus only if it is used as a
stand-alone Java Sound implementation. (Classes needed by plug-ins are
under share/)

lowlevel/

Classes that access hardware or operating system facilities. They
typically include the usage of native methods.

midi/

Classes that are related to the implementation of javax.sound.midi.

sampled/

Classes that are related to the implementation of javax.sound.sampled.

share/

Base and auxiliary classes that are used by implemantations in midi/
and share/. As a rule of thumb, classes go here if they are needed by
more than one plug-in or if they are used generally. However, classes
that are not used by plug-ins go to core/.
